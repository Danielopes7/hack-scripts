> Random scripts to use during pentest

The ultimate goal is to create pipeline such that we can feed in some list of domains/urls and it goes through all the steps.

- [massbanner.sh](massbanner.sh) - Specify file with list of URLs and get the server running
- [setup-pendata.sh](setup-pendata.sh) - Clone popular and useful files and payloads without needing to go to each source
- [setup-sys.sh](setup-sys.sh) - Setups the base system to get into hacking/programming mode

## Installation

The first thing you would want to do after downloading/cloning this repository is to run [setup-sys.sh](setup-sys.sh) and [setup-pendata.sh](setup-pendata.sh) scripts respectively. These two scripts will install various packages, tools and resources that will be useful during your pentesting journey.
